Hello reader,

If you are not a part of Dr. Shannon's lab at NCSU, please contact
Corey DeChant at corey.dechant1@gmail.com. You are probably not suppose
to have these files, as they contain experimental and simulation data.

For those who in Dr. Shannon's lab that need these files, 
below is a short description of each file:

- Microwave-Light-* - Experimental OES measurements

- Steady-State-* - Simulation results

- Simulated_Results.m - Postprocesses the simulation data into 
			a volume average spectria

- OES_Main.m - Postprocesses the experimental OES data

-Simulated_Comparision.m - Plots a comparision between simulated and
                           expermential spectria

-radial_plot.m - Plots the 2D profile of a simulated light intensity
