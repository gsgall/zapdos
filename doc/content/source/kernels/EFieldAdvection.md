# EFieldAdvection

!syntax description /Kernels/EFieldAdvection

## Overview

`EFieldAdvection` is the electric field driven advection term used for variables in logarithmic form.

The strong form for an advection term is usually defined as

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \Gamma_{\text{adv}} = \nabla \cdot \left[ \text{sign}_{j} \mu_{j} n_{j} \ \vec{E} \right]
\end{equation}

Where $\Gamma_{\text{adv}}$ is the advection component of a species' flux, $\text{sign}_{j}$ indicates the advection behavior
($\text{+}1$ for positively charged species and $\text{-}1$ for negatively charged species), $\mu_{j}$ is the mobility coefficient, $n_{j}$ is the density, and $\vec{E}$ is
the electric field. When converting the density to logarithmic form and applying a scaling
factor of the mesh, the strong form for `EFieldAdvection` is defined as

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \Gamma_{\text{adv}} = \nabla \cdot \left[ \text{sign}_{j} \mu_{j} \exp(N_{j}) \ (\vec{E} / l_{c}) \right]
\end{equation}

Where $N_{j}$ is the molar density of the species in logarithmic form and
$l_{c}$ is the scaling factor of the mesh.
