# FieldSolverMaterial

!syntax description /Materials/FieldSolverMaterial

## Overview

`FieldSolverMaterial` provides the electric field as a material property. The calculation of the electric field can either be determined assuming electrostatic or electromagnetic conditions.

When assuming electrostatic conditions (which is the default setting), the electric field is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\vec{E}_{\text{mat.}} = -\nabla V
\end{equation}

where

- $\vec{E}_{\text{mat.}}$ is the electric field as a material property generated by this object, and
- $V$ is a user supplied electrostatic potential.

When assuming electromagnetic conditions, the electic field is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\vec{E}_{\text{mat.}} = \vec{E}
\end{equation}

where

- $\vec{E}$ is a user supplied electric field from an electromagnetic solver.
