# Problem Statement

Consider a single species plasma, an ionic Argon plasma, in a one-dimensional system on the domain $x\in[0, l]$. In this system there is an initial uniform distribution of singly charged Argon ions. This is the same problem as described on page 26-27 of [!cite](lieberman1994principles). This plasma is subject to the electric field generated by its own charge density. Additionally, the walls of this system destroy ions.

\begin{equation}
  - \nabla^2

  =
  \frac{e n_i}{\varepsilon_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  n_i(x, 0) = n_{i0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  n_i(0, t) =
  n_i(l, t) =
  0
\end{equation}

### What would happen ot the rate of the potential decay as pressure changes?

!alert note
The ion mobility and diffusivity $\mu_i$ and $D_i$ are inversly proportional to the pressure.
